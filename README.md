<h3>Spark NFL Predictions</h3>
This project deploys a pyspark model that is used to predict the next NLF play. Specfically, there are two models and I trained on historical NFL Play-by-Play data. There's one model that predicts the expected yards gained or lost for a running play, and similarly a model that predicts yards gained or lost for a passing play. The model will output the expected yardage as well as which play (running or passing) should be executed.
